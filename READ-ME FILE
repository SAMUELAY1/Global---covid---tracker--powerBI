#  Global COVID-19 Tracker (Power BI Dashboard)

##  Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard visualizes the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using the **WHO COVID-19 dataset**.  
The goal of the report is to provide an interactive and data-driven view of:

- Total and new daily COVID-19 cases
- Total and new deaths
- Global death rate percentage
- Country and regional comparisons
- Time-series trends (daily & cumulative)
- 7-day moving average smoothing
- Heat and filled maps for visual geographic analysis

The dashboard allows users to explore the data at **global, regional, and country level** and observe how cases evolve over time.
